## Obsoleted Repository

**This repository is obsolete and is not developed anymore.**

Originally this was intended as a place for sharing the CI code.

But as we started using containers then the shared code is available directly in
the testing containers. See the [yast-ci-ruby](
https://github.com/yast/ci-ruby-container/blob/master/package/yast-ci-ruby) and
the [yast-ci-cpp](
https://github.com/yast/ci-cpp-container/blob/master/package/yast-ci-cpp)
scripts.

### GIT

If you want to see the last state check the [*master_old*](../master_old) branch.
